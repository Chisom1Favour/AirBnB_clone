# AirBnB clone - The console
---
# Description

This team project is part of alx Full-Stack Software Engineer program. It's the first step towards building a first full web application: an AirBnB clone. This first step consists of a custom command-line interface for data management, and the base classes for the storage of this data.

* put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
* create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
* create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
* create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
* create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
